# Pushing Code with Git

## Learning Goals

- Create a remote repository on GitHub
- Connect a local repository to a remote repository
- Set the destination of a repo with `git remote`
- Send code to the remote repo with `git push`

## Introduction

You may have heard of [GitHub](https://github.com) before. In the previous
lesson, you used it to get Facebook's code for the React framework. For all
the amazing power that GitHub provides (Microsoft thought it was so powerful
that they bought GitHub for a cool $7.5 billion), as far as Git is concerned
they're just a big old server that hosts a whole bunch of remote repositories
("remotes").

You've seen how valuable _remotes_ are for _getting_ software. Now we can take a
look at the other side of the transaction: how we mirror our _local_ repository
to a _remote_ repository using `git push` and `git remote`.

Once your code is on a _remote_, it's backed up — which is always a good
thing. Also, once you push to a remote, you can choose whether to let others
`fork` or `clone` and benefit from it. Let's learn how to `push` our code!

## Create a Remote Repository on GitHub

There are a few steps to follow to create a _remote_ repository on GitHub.

1. Go to: [github.com/new](https://github.com/new), while logged into GitHub.

2. Enter a name for your repository in the "Repository name" field. You can name
   it whatever you'd like; be creative! The default options are fine as-is — don't
   initialize the new repository with a `README` or add a `.gitignore` or license.
   Click the green 'Create repository' button.

3. After you create the _remote_ repository, you should see a "Quick setup"
   page. Make sure the 'SSH' option is selected, then click the "Copy to clipboard"
   symbol next to the repo URL (pictured) to copy the URL. (We'll use this in the
   next section.)

Behind the scenes, GitHub has essentially `git init`'d a blank directory.

## Connect a Local Repository to a Remote Repository

After you've created your _remote_ GitHub repository, you'll want to get your
_local_ repository uploaded to GitHub. Follow the steps below:

1. First, we want to create a folder for our repository, which we'll call
   `my_new_directory`. In the terminal, navigate to the `~/Development/code`
   directory (or wherever you are storing your code) and type
   `mkdir my_new_directory`.

2. To navigate into this new folder, type `cd my_new_directory`. Your terminal
   should display `my_new_directory`, indicating that you are now inside of the
   new folder. Open the directory in VS Code by typing `code .`.

3. Next, we need to create a new file named `README.md`. You can do this in the
   terminal, by typing `touch README.md`, or in VS Code, by choosing
   `File -> New File`.

4. We can directly type in content for our README file in VS Code, but we can
   also use our terminal skills to add content. So, in the terminal, type
   `echo "This is my readme file" > README.md`. If you've got the README file
   open in VS Code, the new text will appear!

5. Now that we've got some basic content, we can initialize our local
   repository. In your terminal, type `git init`. Your terminal should show that
   an 'empty Git repository' has been initialized.

6. Type `git add README.md` to stage the new `README.md` file so it will be
   tracked by `git`.

7. Now, type `git commit -m "Initialize git"`. This will create the first commit
   for this local repository, which will allow us to push our work to the remote
   repository we created earlier.

## Set the Destination of a Repo with `git remote`

To connect your local repository to the newly created GitHub repository, you
must add a new remote to a remote name. Adding a remote involves giving `git` a
"short name" and a "repository path." You copied the repository path from GitHub
a few steps above.

The repository path is a long bunch of technical words. The creators of Git
thought it would be easier to type a "nickname" or a "short name" that points to
that long repository path. It's common to have a "default" remote. The default
remote short name is called `origin`. So we're going to create a new remote with a
short name of `origin`.

Make sure you still have your remote Git info copied from GitHub, and type the
following into the terminal:

```console
$ git remote add origin your-copied-remote-repository-url
```

This sets the remote so you can now **_push_** your code.

You can use `git remote -v` (the `-v` is for "verbose") to view the remote(s).

```console
$ git remote -v
View existing remotes
origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

## Send Code to the Remote Repo with `git push`

Now that we have added a remote repo, we need to send our latest work to the
remote. We use this command when we want to send some code from the local
repository to the associated remote repository. Git will push all the local,
committed work to the remote repository.

The `git push` command takes two arguments. The first is the name of the remote
repo. Remember, `origin` is just an alias or "short name" that refers to the
repository name. You don't actually have to enter the repository name. Instead,
you can just use `origin`. The second is the name of the remote branch you want
to send code to. In the example below, we're pushing to our remote repository's
_default_ branch.

Depending on your system configuration, your default branch's name might be
either `main` or `master`. You can find out what the default branch for your
current repository is by running:

```console
$ git branch --show-current
```

Whatever the branch listed in the terminal is will be your default branch (it
should be either `master` or `main`).

If your default branch name is `master`, run this command to push your code up
to GitHub:

```console
$ git push -u origin master
```

**Otherwise**, if your default branch name is `main`, run this command to push
your code up to GitHub:

```console
$ git push -u origin main
```

This will push your code up to the remote repo/branch. The first time you push
code up to a newly-added remote repository, use the `-u` flag to tell Git to
"save" the remote repository as the default push destination for your current
branch.

For every subsequent push, you only need to enter `git push`.

## An Aside and a Small Shortcut

In this lesson, we've gone through the steps of both connecting a local
repository, and pushing code up to GitHub. During this course, you'll be
creating a few local repositories from scratch, but more often, you'll be
cloning existing repositories to your local machine. In these situations, you
won't need to use commands like `git init`, since the repo is already set up
with Git and will already have a remote configured.

However, you _will_ often need to add, commit and push work you've done locally
to the remote repository. Luckily, the `learn test` command will accomplish all
of this for you. To do the process by hand, however, you would run the following
commands:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push
```

As a small shortcut, you can also combine adding all **tracked** files and
committing by using an additional option flag, `-a`, with the commit command:

```console
$ git commit -am "commit message"
$ git push
```

Note that the `-am` flags will work for adding and committing changes to files
that are **already being tracked**, but if you need to create a new file as part
of any lesson, you'll need to use `git add` to track that file before you can
commit it.

## Conclusion

Being able to add Git remotes allows you to back up your local repository to a
remote server. To review, the process is:

- run `git init` to start tracking your local repo
- run `git remote add origin your-remote-repository-URL` to tie your local repo
  to the remote repo on GitHub
- use `git add` and `git commit` to save your changes
- use `git push` to push the changes up to the remote repo

With these few steps, you'll be able to get your project up to GitHub in
minutes!
